**🚨 Problem Statement**
---

Abode Software needed to:

 - Reduce manual deployment time and errors

 - Implement automated testing before production

 - Separate development testing from production deployments

 - Containerize the application for environment consistency

 - Automate infrastructure setup


**🔄 Pipeline Workflow**
---

- When Code is Pushed to DEVELOP Branch:

```
1. GitHub Webhook Triggers Jenkins
2. Job 1: Build → Checkout code + Build Docker image
3. Job 2: Test → Run automated tests
4. ❌ Job 3: SKIP Production deployment
5. ✅ Pipeline Complete (No prod deployment)
```
- When Code is Pushed to MASTER Branch:

```
1. GitHub Webhook Triggers Jenkins
2. Job 1: Build → Checkout code + Build Docker image
3. Job 2: Test → Run automated tests
4. ✅ Job 3: Deploy to Production
5. 🎉 Live on Production Server
```


**⚡ Quick Start Guide**
---

- Step 1: Setup Infrastructure with Ansible
```
bash# Install Ansible
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ansible -y

# Run infrastructure setup
cd ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.ini playbooks/setup.yml
```
- Step 2: Configure Jenkins
```
bash# Access Jenkins
http://your-jenkins-server:8080

# Install Required Plugins:
- Git Plugin
- Docker Pipeline Plugin
- GitHub Integration Plugin

# Add Credentials:
- GitHub Personal Access Token
- Docker Hub Credentials
```
- Step 3: Create Jenkins Pipeline
  
  - New Item → Pipeline
  - Configure GitHub webhook: http://jenkins-server:8080/github-webhook/
  - Pipeline script from SCM → Select this repository
  - Save and test with a push

- Step 4: Test the Pipeline
```
bash# Clone the application
git clone https://github.com/hshar/website.git
cd website

# Make a change and push to develop (test only)
git checkout develop
echo "Test change" >> README.md
git commit -am "test: trigger pipeline"
git push origin develop

# Push to master (full deployment)
git checkout master
git merge develop
git push origin master
```

```

**✨ Key Features*
---

1. Intelligent Branch-Based Deployment
   - Develop branch: Build + Test only
   - Master branch: Build + Test + Production deployment
   - Prevents accidental production deployments

2. Automated Testing
   - Unit tests run automatically
   - Integration tests before deployment
   - Deployment blocked if tests fail

3. Docker Containerization
   - Application packaged in Docker container
   - Uses trusted base image: hshar/webapp
   - Application deployed to /var/www/html
   - Consistent environments across all stages

5. Infrastructure as Code
   - Ansible playbooks for server setup
   - Automated Jenkins configuration
   - Repeatable infrastructure deployment

5. Zero-Downtime Deployment
   - Blue-green deployment strategy
   - Health checks before switching traffic
   - Automatic rollback on failure

    - Build Docker image with application
    - Tag image with build number
    - Push to Docker Hub

  - Job 2: TEST
    - Pull Docker image
    - Run automated test suite
    - Generate test reports
    - Fail pipeline if tests fail
  
  - Job 3: PROD (Master branch only)
